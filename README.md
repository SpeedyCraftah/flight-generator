# flight-generator
Allows you to generate a random flight between two airports based on multiple different parameters including start or destination airport, time of flight and random airports, specifically designed for flight simulator players as well as real life pilots looking for a configurable random flight generation tool, with a solid accuracy (+- 15 minutes estimate vs actual time).

## What can this do?
- Generates random flights based on various parameters.
- Allows you to set a starting and/or destination airport using IATA codes.
- Allows you to adjust flight details like speed, altitude, and estimated time.
- Lets you specify country codes for origin and destination airports.
- Lets you filter airports by size (small, medium, large).
- Calculates distances in nautical miles between airports.
- Provides flight details including estimated time and distance.
- Estimate durations are calculated by taking into account realistic parameters and differentiates between perceived airspeed vs actual airspeed (depending on altitude).

## Footnotes
I created this back when me and my friend played a lot of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (and FSX), and wanted a good tool that randomly generates flights based on a bunch of different parameters and requirements, when a lot of the existing tools were either inaccurate or did not allow any configuration. I figured now this would be a good addition to the open source community.
